# Adobe I/O Meta-Documentation

Welcome to the repo for our documentation. This is the source for some content on
[Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/), specifically the [Documentation Style Guide](./opensource/doc-style.md)

Feel free to send us pull requests and file issues. Our documentation is completely
Open Source and we deeply appreciate contributions from our community.

## Providing feedback

We really want your feedback, and we've made it easy by filing issues directly on GitHub.

**Please only file issues about the documentation in this repository.** One way
to think about this is that you should file a bug here if your issue is that you
don't see something that should be in the docs, or you see something incorrect
or confusing in the docs.

## Contributing

We value your documentation contributions, and we want to make it as easy
as possible to work in this repository. One of the first things to decide is
which branch to base your work on. If you get confused, just ask and we will
help. If a reviewer realizes you have based your work on the wrong branch, we'll
let you know so that you can rebase it.

### Overall doc improvements

Most commits will be made against the `master` branch. This include:

- Conceptual and task-based information not specific to new features
- Restructuring / rewriting
- Doc bug fixing
- Typos and grammar errors

>Do you enjoy creating graphics? Good graphics are key to great documentation,
and we especially value contributions in this area.

## Relative linking for GitHub viewing

Feel free to link to `../foo.md` so that the docs are readable in GitHub. In general it's best to assume the docs are being read
directly on [Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/).

## Style guide

If you have questions about how to write for Adobe I/O documentation, please see
the [style guide](./opensource/doc-style.md). The style guide provides
guidance about grammar, syntax, formatting, styling, language, or tone. If
something isn't clear in the guide, please submit an issue to let us know or
submit a pull request to help us improve it.
